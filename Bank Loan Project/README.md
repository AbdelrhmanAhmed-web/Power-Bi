## 📝 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven analysis of banking loan operations, focusing on **Loan Portfolio Health, Credit Risk Assessment, and Profitability Trends**. The goal is to help bank managers monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), track "Good" vs. "Bad" loans, and understand borrower behavior through DTI and Grade analysis.

## 🛠️ Skills Showcase
### 1. SQL Data Exploration & Transformation
- **KPI Extraction:** Used **SQL Server** to calculate Total Applications, Funded Amounts, and Payments Received with Month-over-Month (MoM) growth tracking.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** - **Window Functions:** Employed `LAG()` and `OVER()` to analyze month-to-month performance changes.
  - **Data Type Conversion:** Used `CAST` and numeric multiplication for precise percentage and ratio calculations.
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data integrity by handling loan statuses and categorizing borrowers based on credit grades.

### 2. DAX Modeling & Power BI Visualization
- **Complex DAX Measures:** Developed measures to calculate Running Totals, Average Interest Rates, and Average DTI dynamically.
- **Risk Framework:** Created a logic-based classification to distinguish between **"Good Loans"** (Fully Paid/Current) and **"Bad Loans"** (Charged Off).

## 📊 Dashboard Key Features

### 1. Executive Summary (KPIs)
- **Total Loan Applications:** Monitoring the volume of requests and MoM fluctuations.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Real-time tracking of the capital disbursed by the bank.
- **Total Amount Received:** Analyzing the cash inflow from borrower repayments.

### 2. Credit Risk & Grade Analysis
- **DTI Ratio Insights:** Investigating the "Debt-to-Income" ratio across different loan grades to identify high-risk segments.
- **The Grade G Paradox:** Analysis revealed that high-income borrowers (~$95K) often fall into lower grades due to large loan amounts ($20K+), resulting in higher interest rates (21.4%).


### 3. Purpose & Regional Trends
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown:** Identifying that **Debt Consolidation** and **Credit Cards** are the primary drivers of loan applications.
- **State-wise Distribution:** Visualizing lending activity across different regions to identify geographic growth opportunities.

## 📌 Conclusion
This **Bank Loan Dashboard** transforms raw financial records into a strategic monitoring tool. By correlating DTI ratios with interest rates and loan grades, it provides clear evidence of how the bank mitigates risk through tiered pricing.

### Through this project, I have successfully:
- **Processed & Aggregated** massive financial datasets using SQL for high-performance reporting.
- **Visualized Risk Factors** that directly impact the bank's bottom line and recovery rates.
- **Translated Technical Data** into business-oriented insights regarding borrower creditworthiness.
